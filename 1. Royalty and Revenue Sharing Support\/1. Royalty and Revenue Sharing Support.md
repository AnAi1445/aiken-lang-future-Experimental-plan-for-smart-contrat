To support NFTs with built-in royalties for artists and creators, a standard library function could be created to simplify royalty calculations and revenue distribution.

## Description:

calculate_royalty: Computes royalty based on a specified percentage.
distribute_revenue: Distributes funds to multiple recipients based on their share, which could be used in NFT sales to ensure royalties are split among contributors.
